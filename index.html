<p>Here is a riddle for you:</p>
<p>
  Three people check into a hotel room. The clerk says the bill is $30,
  so each guest pays $10. Later the clerk realizes the bill should only be $25.
  To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 to return to the guests.
  On the way to the room, the bellhop realizes that
  he cannot divide the money equally.
  As the guests didn't know the total of the revised bill,
  the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1
  and keep $2 as a tip for himself.
  Each guest got $1 back, so now each guest only paid $9,
  bringing the total paid to $27. The bellhop has $2.
  And $27 + $2 = $29 so, if the guests originally handed over $30,
  what happened to the remaining $1?
