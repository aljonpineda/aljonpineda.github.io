    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
  Hello! My name is Aljon Pineda. I am 17 years old.
  I was born on August 15, 1999 in Staten Island, NY, then I moved to GA
  in the summer of 2009. Now I live in Tucker.
  I graduated from Meadowcreek High School in 2017, and
  I will attend Georgia Tech this fall.

  <h2>What I Do in My Free Time</h2>
  <p>
  In my free time, my favorite thing to do is play
  video games with my friends. Whenever I have the chance,
  I would play my favorite game, Overwatch. What I also
  love to do is read books, especially the detective
  fiction genre. Recently, I got into the interest
  of writing my own detective fiction book.
